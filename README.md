2dWaveSolver.c solves the 2d wave equation using parallel programming. The equation is solved for a different number of threads.
Parallel speedup and efficiency are measured for each case. Time elapsed, parallel speedup, parallel efficiency and the last (t = 20) central value for each total thread number case is printed as output.

t0,t5,t10,t20 files contain the numerical and analytical solution 3d plots for t = 0,5,10,20 respectively
(tside files contain the same 3d plots from a different point of view).

speedup and efficiency files contain the Parallel Speedup/Efficiency - Number of threads plots.
